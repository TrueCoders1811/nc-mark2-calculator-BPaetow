## NC-Mark2-Calculator

1. Create a Calculator class
2. Fill the class with the methods: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide
3. In the Program Class within the Main method build out a user interface that asks the user which method they would like to use.
   Then get two numbers from them and run them through the chosen method.

This is a git based project, so make sure to make commits when necessary.
I will be looking for at least 3 commits, but more will not hurt.
**Make sure you are working on a branch other than master!**

Once the project is finished, push your branch to gitHub and make a pull request
